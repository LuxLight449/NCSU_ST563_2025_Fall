    "During the learning process, excessive reliance on AI tools like ChatGPT may lead to some ethical and learning-related issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, it may weaken one's critical thinking ability. When facing problems, if we habitually seek answers directly from ChatGPT instead of first thinking, analyzing, and trying ourselves, we will gradually lose the ability to solve problems independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, it may affect intellectual independence. The essence of learning is not only to obtain answers, but also to cultivate logical reasoning, problem decomposition, and autonomous exploration skills. If every step relies on AI providing ready-made solutions, the growth of one's knowledge system and experience accumulation will be limited.\n",

I promise that I will not copy and paste (even manually, by hand) from generative AI tools, and I will maintain a high work ethic in the reports I produce.I understand and agree that any discrepancy between my quiz performance and the quality of my homework, or between the quality of my midterm/final reports and my presentation and Q&A performance, can result in a significant reduction of my score.
